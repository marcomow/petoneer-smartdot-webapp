# Petoneer Smart Dot Webapp
A webapp to directly control the [Petoneer Smart Dot](https://www.petoneer.com/playdot), without the need of the official app.

See details about the reverse-engineered protocol [here](https://github.com/marcomow/petoneer-smartdot-bluetooth-protocol).

I learned how to reverse engineer a bluetooth device thanks to [@urish](https://github.com/urish)! 
In particular I took inspiration from these articles:
- [Reverse Engineering a Bluetooth Lightbulb](https://urish.medium.com/reverse-engineering-a-bluetooth-lightbulb-56580fcb7546)
- [Start Building with Web Bluetooth and Progressive Web Apps](https://urish.medium.com/start-building-with-web-bluetooth-and-progressive-web-apps-6534835959a6)
